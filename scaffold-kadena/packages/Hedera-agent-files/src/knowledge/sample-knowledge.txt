Hedera Hashgraph Knowledge Base

Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that provides a fast, fair, and secure platform for building decentralized applications. Here are the key aspects of Hedera:

1. Consensus Algorithm
Hedera uses a unique consensus algorithm called Hashgraph, which is based on the gossip protocol. This allows for high throughput (10,000+ transactions per second) and low latency (3-5 seconds finality). The algorithm is patented and provides Byzantine fault tolerance.

2. Network Architecture
Hedera operates as a public network with a governing council of up to 39 term-limited organizations. These organizations include major corporations like Google, IBM, Boeing, and others. The council ensures decentralization while maintaining network stability.

3. Native Cryptocurrency
HBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network. It serves multiple purposes:
- Network fees for transactions
- Staking for network security
- Payment for services
- Governance participation

4. Services Offered
Hedera provides several services:
- Cryptocurrency: HBAR token transfers
- Smart Contracts: Solidity-compatible smart contracts
- Consensus Service: Timestamping and ordering of events
- Token Service: Creating and managing custom tokens
- File Service: Decentralized file storage

5. Transaction Costs
Hedera offers predictable and low transaction costs:
- Cryptocurrency transfers: $0.0001 USD
- Smart contract calls: $0.05 USD
- File storage: $0.10 per GB per month
- Consensus service: $0.0001 per message

6. Security Features
- Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT)
- No proof-of-work mining (energy efficient)
- Deterministic finality
- Immutable transaction history
- Built-in compliance tools

7. Development Tools
Hedera provides comprehensive development tools:
- Hedera SDKs for multiple programming languages
- Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for event streaming
- Hedera Token Service (HTS) for token creation
- Smart contract development with Solidity
- REST APIs for easy integration

8. Use Cases
Common use cases for Hedera include:
- Supply chain tracking
- Identity verification
- Payment processing
- Data integrity
- Gaming and NFTs
- DeFi applications
- Enterprise solutions

9. Network Information
- Mainnet launched: September 2019
- Testnet available for development
- Network nodes operated by council members
- Public network with permissioned consensus
- Regular network upgrades and improvements
